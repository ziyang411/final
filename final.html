                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Xue Zhiqian, born in 1983 in Shanghai.He debuted in 2005 in a talent show and became popular nationwide with "Serious Snow", after which he was hidden by his company for ten years. In order to pursue his music dream, he opened hot pot restaurants and sold clothes to save money for music. These ten years were the most painful ten years of his life, suffering from very serious depression, being cyber-violated by rumors spread by the Internet, and losing his grandmother and grandmother who accompanied him since childhood, but he did not give up his music dream, and used all the money he earned from doing business on music production. It wasn't until 2018 that the sound of his music resounded again, with a total of 34 concerts, but the response was mediocre until 2023, when the Alien tour traveled to 9 countries, 61 cities, and a total of 140 concerts, all of which were sold out!.</p>
